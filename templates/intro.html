    <p class="lead">Education is a key factor for achieving a long-term economic progress. During the last decades, the Portuguese educational level has improved. However, the statistics keep the Portugal at Europeâ€™s tail end due to its high student failure and dropping out rates. For example, in 2006 the early school leaving rate in Portugal was 40% for 18 to 24 year olds, while the European Union average value was just 15% (Eurostat 2007). In particular, failure in the core classes of Mathematics and Portuguese (the native language) is extremely serious, since they
        provide fundamental knowledge for the success in the remaining school subjects (e.g. physics or history).
        </p>
    
    <p class="lead">Some of the intresting questions raised with the data are:<br>
        1)Are the students with good health getting most grades? <br>
        2)Is students going out more affect the grades?<br>
        3)What type of courses can be offered to attract more students?<br>
        4)Is is possible to predict student performance? <br>
        5)What are the factors that affect student achievement? <br><br>
        
        We tried to analyse these questions and modeling student performance is an important aspect for both educators and
        students, since it can help a better understanding of this phenomenon and ultimately improve it.
